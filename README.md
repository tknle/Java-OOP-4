# Java Object Oriented Programming 4
Java Programming by Duke University on Coursera

## Description
Solve real world problems with Java using multiple classes. Know how to create programming solutions 
that scale using Java interfaces. Recognize that software engineering is more than writing code - it 
also involves logical thinking and design. Build a program that analyzes and sorts earthquake data, 
and developed a predictive text generator.

## Outcome
1. Use sorting appropriately in solving problems;
2. Develop classes that implement the Comparable interface;
3. Use timing data to analyze empirical performance;
4. Break problems into multiple classes, each with their own methods;
5. Determine if a class from the Java API can be used in solving a particular problem;
6. Implement programming solutions using multiple approaches and recognize tradeoffs;
7. Use object-oriented concepts including interfaces and abstract classes when developing programs;
8. Appropriately hide implementation decisions so they are not visible in public methods; and
9. Recognize the limitations of algorithms and Java programs in solving problems.
10. Recognize standard Java classes and idioms including exception-handling, static methods, java.net, 
and java.io packages.
